## Initializing: 
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Boundedline function used to mark the normal region can be retrieved from the following: 
Kelly Kearney (2020). boundedline.m (https://github.com/kakearney/boundedline-pkg), GitHub. Retrieved December 12, 2020.
3. Extract boundedline-pkg to MATLAB directory. 
4. Add DetermineDelayTherapy.m function file to MATLAB directory. 
5. Add GCM_Algorithm_Parameter_Data.mat file to MATLAB directory. 
6. Open and run the algorithm file, GCM_Algorithm_for_TIC.m.
7. When prompted to input factor concentration values, use the trauma patient coagulation factor concentration measurements provided as a sample data set.
